# contributing

## style

the formatting rules can be found in the [eslint config]. please run `npm run
fix` to lint all the files before committing.

keep names short but not too vague. this isn't really a hard limit so it's
really up to discussion.

as we're using typescript, it's inevitable that we'll find a use case for an
experimental feature. try to limit yourself to at least [stage-3] proposals when
you do, or come up with a very convincing reason why you need it.

## issues & pull requests

when opening issues please state which module(s) or file this concerns.

please only work on one module at a time for pull requests if you can.

thank you for contributing!
